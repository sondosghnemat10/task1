
<p> Hello, my name is Sondos Ghanimat, a resident of the city of Hebron. 
    I am a university student at Hebron University.
    I study computer science. I am married and work as a housewife. 
    I have a five-month-old daughter. My life is difficult and I find it very difficult to reconcile my studies, my home, and my child. 
    But with Godâ€™s kindness, all things are facilitated, and praise be to God.  </p>
